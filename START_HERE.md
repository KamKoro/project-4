## ❓ I Have Questions

### What changed in my project?

**Configuration Files:**
- ✅ `Procfile` - Added to project root
- ✅ `runtime.txt` - Added to project root
- ✅ `backend/requirements.txt` - Updated with production packages
- ✅ `backend/recipe_app/settings.py` - Updated for production
- ✅ `backend/recipe_app/urls.py` - Updated to serve React
- ✅ `README.md` - Added deployment section

**Documentation Added:**
- 📘 `COURSE_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Bootcamp-aligned guide
- 📊 `DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md` - Configuration overview
- 📚 `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Comprehensive guide
- ⚡ `QUICK_START_DEPLOY.md` - Quick reference
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` - Pre-flight checklist
- 🎯 `START_HERE.md` - This file!
- 🎉 `DEPLOYMENT_READY.md` - Ready to deploy notice
- 🤖 `deploy.sh` - Automated deployment script

### Do I need to install new packages locally?

Yes, update your local environment:

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs: `gunicorn`, `whitenoise`, `dj-database-url`, `psycopg2-binary`

### Will my local development still work?

**Yes!** The configuration automatically detects the environment:

- **Local** (no `ON_HEROKU`): Uses SQLite, DEBUG=True, localhost CORS
- **Heroku** (`ON_HEROKU=1`): Uses PostgreSQL, DEBUG=False, production settings

Your local development is completely unaffected!

### What environment variables do I need on Heroku?

Only **3 environment variables**:

```bash
SECRET_KEY=<generate-this-with-django-utils>
ON_HEROKU=1
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com
```

Everything else (DEBUG, ALLOWED_HOSTS, DATABASE) is auto-configured!

### What about my .env file?

**Keep it local!** 
- It's already in `.gitignore`
- Never commit `.env` to git
- On Heroku, use `heroku config:set` instead

### Do I need to build React every time?

**Before deploying, yes:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
cd ..
```

Django serves the `frontend/build/` files in production.

### What about uploaded images?

⚠️ **Important:** Heroku's filesystem is ephemeral! Uploaded recipe images will be **deleted** on dyno restart.

**For production, use cloud storage:**
- Cloudinary (recommended)
- AWS S3
- Azure Blob Storage

This is a known limitation of Heroku's free tier.

---

## 🎯 Quick Start (TL;DR)

```bash
# 1. Install new packages locally
cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt && cd ..

# 2. Build React app
cd frontend && npm run build && cd ..

# 3. Commit everything
git add .
git commit -m "Configure for Heroku deployment"

# 4. Run automated deployment
./deploy.sh

# OR follow the course guide
# Open COURSE_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
```

---

## 🆘 Help! Something's Not Working

1. **Check logs:** `heroku logs --tail`
2. **Verify environment variables:** `heroku config`
3. **Check troubleshooting sections** in the deployment guides
4. **Ask your instructors** - they're there to help!

---

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Choose your deployment method above and get your app live!

**Remember:**
- ✅ Build React before deploying
- ✅ Use Eco dynos to stay within free tier
- ✅ Test thoroughly after deployment
- ✅ Update your GitHub README with production URL

**Good luck! 🚀🍕**
